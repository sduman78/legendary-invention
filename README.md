I graduated from Ms. Accountancy program at University of Houston-Clear Lake in May, 2014 and currently working towards passing the CPA exam  
I have performed a wide variety of accounting and payroll activities during my career. I worked at start-ups, non-profit/for profit  companies and I gained extensive knowledge in my profession. I am experienced in Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable,order processing, deferred revenue, applying revenue recognition principles, supply chain management, processing expense reports, inventory management, creating customized reports for management, reconciliations, month end close, preparing financial statements,  etc. I am very good at working the full accounting cycle.

I am team-oriented, well-organized, and a fast-learner. I have strong problem solving and analytical skills. I can find practical solutions to complex issues and problems and I am open to continuous improvement in my job. I am very enthusiastic, energetic and creative. 

I love gardening, travel, and cooking. In my spare times I would love to work on different home projects and spend time with my children and invest in their education. I also volunteer at different community organizations to help needy.
